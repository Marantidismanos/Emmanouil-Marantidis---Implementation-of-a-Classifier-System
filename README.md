Title : Implementation of a Classifier System with a fixed number of rules, capable of chain rule activation (reasoning) for application to clustering problems


The purpose of this work is to develop an example Classifier System with the ability to genetically evolve sets of rules (if then rules) that simulate a desired input-output behavior. A CS model will be developed that has a fixed set of rules, with "rule forces" and a Bucket Brigade Algorithm, which will be applied to a simple classification problem (Classification) The CS rule set will be genetically evolved using a Genetic Algorithm, which will use : 
1. Population of solutions (rules)
2.  Parent selection method (Roulette wheel)
3.  Multi-point Crossover operator (Multi-point Crossover)
4.  Mutation operator (Mutation)
5.  Elitism
6.  Variable termination criteria
7.   User-defined parameters In this work, the effectiveness of CS in application problems will be studied for various values of the parameters.
